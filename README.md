# Artificial Recurrent Network Evolution

This project was created in the context of a bachelor thesis.

## Abstract

This thesis examines the application of the principles of artificial evolution to the problem of image recognition, in particular the recognition of electronic components in hand-drawn circuit diagrams.
Evolution, a biological process that has ensured over billions of years that living beings have adapted better and better to their environment and the reality of life, serves as a model for the optimization process in this context.
The aim is to develop an algorithm that reliably recognizes components and connections and outputs the results as a netlist.
The optimization process is based on the use of agents that are trained on specific training data.
These agents are crossed and mutated with each other, following the example of biological evolution, to ensure variation from the population.
The study shows that artificial evolution is a promising approach to solve the optimization problem of image recognition.
